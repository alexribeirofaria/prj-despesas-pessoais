## Introduction

In summary, this project involves an update backend and frontend applications using .NET Core in backend and angularin frontend. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is implemented using XUnit, generating test coverage reports locally with ReportGenerator. CI/CD is implemented with GitActions/Workflows, which perform "Build, Unit Testing, and Static Code Analysis in the cloud using Sonar Cloud.". The application is currently in production on an AWS EC2 server, ensuring high availability.
The Backend API provides services for managing personal finances in a simple and straightforward way. Through its endpoints, it is possible to record expenses and income, view reports, obtain consolidated graphs, and organize financial information in a practical and efficient manner.
In the front-end integrated with the API using Angular and TypeScript, Angular makes HTTP requests to the API endpoints, allowing financial data to be displayed dynamically in real time. TypeScript's strong typing ensures better security and organization in the code, making development and maintenance easier.
